**Explain the difference between an experiment and a trial.**
An experiment is a well-designed/structured procedure with defined possible results while a trial is a single instance of an experiment.

**Explain the difference between an outcome and an event.**
Outcomes are the result of performing a trial while an event can include multiple trial outcomes.

**Come up with a real world example of each perspective of probability (classical, empirical, and subjective) that was not mentioned in class.**
An example of the classical perspective of probability that is the statistical math aspect of probability would be the fractional probability of picking a certain color marble from a bag of marbles of different colors where there is the same number of each color in the bag.
An example of the empirical perspective would be the fractional results of picking a marble out x number of times wiith varying numbers of each color marble.
An example of subjective probability could be the results of a poll sample to a certain population sample size.

**Explain the difference between descriptive and inferential statistics.**
Descriptive statistics are the mathematical summaries of a certain dataset into a single value while inferential statistics are used to extrapolate information about a population data from a certain sample dataset.

**Explain the difference between frequentist and Bayesian statistics.**
Frequentist statistics attempts to create a number based on liklihood of an occurence mathematically while Bayesian statistics attempts to produce a distribution of the outcome allowing for the the outcome to exist about some centralized point for a dataset.
