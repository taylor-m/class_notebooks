-- Using the dvdrentals database:
-- Return all matching records as a result of joining 
-- the payment and customer tables. Keep only records found in both tables.

-- How do we think these tables join up?
-- To prove out the foreign keyness of this field we 
-- could also view the table constraints.



-- Lets now perform the join
-- Reminder of the prompt: 
-- "Keep only records found in both tables"



-- Return the first name, last name and address of 
-- customers as a result of joining the customer and address tables. 
-- Keep only records found in both tables.



-- We can keep the JOIN ðŸš‚ rolling and join on join on join on join on join on join on join on join on join...
-- Add payment amounts to the last query



-- When joining many tables it can be useful to specify
-- what table everything is coming from, even though it isn't necesary.
-- If you hadn't already, add table specifiers before every
-- column you mention in the SELECT clause



-- We can also JOIN a table to itself
-- Example potential use case:
-- We have a 'people' table modeled like below.
-- We could join it to itself to get a marriage per row.
-- |  id  |  name  | married_to |
-- |:----:|:------:|:----------:|
-- |  1   | Skyler |     3      |
-- |  2   | Elliot |    NULL    |
-- |  3   | Peyton |     1      |


-- Don't have a great setup for our dvdrentals data
-- but this is how a self JOIN query could look like.
-- This is also a use case for aliasing where its not
-- only an aid to readability.
