    "So far, this program has covered decision trees growing with an entropy criterion. In doing so, however, the program glossed over how that actually works. In this checkpoint, you'll get more detail into how an algorithm that does that would practically function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, you'll learn about one popular algorithm for building a decision tree using entropy and information gain: *ID3*.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The ID3 algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "ID3 stands for *Iterative Dichotomizer 3*, and it's one of the simplest ways to create a decision tree. ID3 can be generalized into more robust scenarios, but the implementation is based on the framework that you'll go over here. Essentially, ID3 goes through every feature to find the most valuable attribute, and then it splits the node based on that attribute. Then it moves further and further down the tree until it either has a pure class or meets a terminating condition. The details are explored further below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you can start working with ID3, however, there are some requirements for the data in this most basic form. Firstly, outcomes have to be binary. The simplest version of ID3 is a binary classifier. Also, the attributes that you use to build the tree have to be categorical. Attributes can have many categories, but they must be known and countable.\n",
    "\n",
    "If those two criteria are met, then you can build a basic ID3 classifying algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other thing that you'll need for this is the definition of entropy. Recall from the previous assignment that you're going to use Shannon Entropy $H$, defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ H = -\\sum_{i=1}^n P(x_i)log_2 P(x_i) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "For simplicity of calculation, you're actually going to do a slight transform on this definition. Recall from a (quite possibly long ago) algebra class that you can bring exponentials out to the front of a logarithm. In this case, you'll raise the probability to `-1`, changing the formula to the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ H = \\sum_{i=1}^n P(x_i)log_2 \\frac{1}{P(x_i)} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This removes the negative sign up front, and will make it easier for you to implement this formula."

    "## Calculating entropy\n",
    "\n",
    "Because this algorithm is based on entropy, go over a quick example of how to calculate it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Say that you have 20 students, and you're trying to classify them as male or female. The only attribute that you have is whether their height is tall, medium, or short. Of the 20 students, 12 are boys and 8 are girls. Of the 12 boys, 4 are tall, 6 are medium, and 2 are short. Of the 8 girls, 1 is tall, 2 are medium, and 5 are short.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the entropy before any rule is applied? And what is the entropy after applying a rule for being tall?\n",
    "\n",
    "The initial entropy is just the formula plugged in over both the possible classes of interest:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ H = P(male)*log_2 \\frac{1}{P(male)} + P(female)*log_2 \\frac{1}{P(female)}  $$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ = \\frac{12}{20}*log_2 \\frac{20}{12} + \\frac{8}{20}*log_2 \\frac{20}{8} = .971 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "What if you apply the rule `height = short`? You need to calculate the weighted average of the two entropies, one for the short students and one for the students who aren't short.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ H(short) = P(male)*log_2 \\frac{1}{P(male)} + P(female)*log_2 \\frac{1}{P(female)}  $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ = \\frac{2}{7}*log_2 \\frac{7}{2} + \\frac{5}{7}*log_2 \\frac{7}{5} = .863 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ H(not\\_short) = P(male)*log_2 \\frac{1}{P(male)} + P(female)*log_2 \\frac{1}{P(female)}  $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ = \\frac{10}{13}*log_2 \\frac{13}{10} + \\frac{3}{13}*log_2 \\frac{13}{3} = .779 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that all the probabilities here are conditional on the criteria that you're assuming (short or not short). The weighted average of the two is this:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(short) * H(short) + P(not\\_short) * H(not\\_short) = \\frac{7}{20} * .863 + \\frac{13}{20} * .779 = .809 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "So the entropy from this question would go from `0.971` to `0.809`. That's an improvement! Use the space below to calculate the entropy of the other criteria, because you also know whether the students are tall or medium."
