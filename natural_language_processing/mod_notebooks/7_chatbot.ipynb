    "# What are chatbots?\n",
    "\n",
    "Before moving on to implementation, take a moment to think about chatbots. In a nutshell, chatbots are intelligent software programs that aim to use conversations in natural languages to help humans in specific tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, Microsoft's Cortana, and Apple's Siri are all well-known examples of chatbots. Probably, you've already encountered many others on websites, Slack, or mobile apps. But chatbots are not at all new. Probably the first chatbot is [Eliza](http://psych.fullerton.edu/mbirnbaum/psych101/Eliza.htm?utm_source=ubisend.com&utm_medium=blog-link&utm_campaign=ubisend), which was developed in the 1960s to emulate a Rogerian psychotherapist.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chatbots are quite popular across many industries, and their popularity seems to increase from year to year. According to [Gartner's estimates](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2018-02-19-gartner-says-25-percent-of-customer-service-operations-will-use-virtual-customer-assistants-by-2020), \"25% of customer service operations will use virtual customer assistants by 2020.\" Gartner [also estimates that](https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/chatbots-will-appeal-to-modern-workers/) \"by 2022, 70% of white-collar workers will interact with conversational platforms on a daily basis.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "And the main driving forces behind chatbots are NLP and its machine-learning applications."

    "# Approaches in the development of chatbots\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditionally, chatbots were developed using rule-based systems. Rule-based approaches are still used to some degree today. But since the early 2010s, efforts have shifted to focus more on using the power of machine learning. So, there are two general approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The first approach is the *rule-based approach* that rests upon clearly defined rules derived for the specific task that the chatbot was designed to handle. However, determining all the rules for complex interactions is almost impossible. As a result, the popularity of this approach has dramatically diminished in recent years.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The second approach is to use *machine learning* to discover hidden patterns and rules from the data. With the increase in the availability of training data and advances in the applications of machine learning in speech recognition and NLP, most modern chatbots, if not all, are developed based on learning from the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, this is a simplistic overview of the approaches for chatbot development. But for the purpose of this module, it's sufficient. So this module won't go further into the details of other approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the remainder of this checkpoint, you'll use a mix of both approaches, but the second approach will do the heavy lifting. You'll develop your chatbots using the NLP techniques that you've learned so far in this module, as well as the machine-learning techniques that you learned earlier in the program. First, you'll implement a chatbot from scratch, using Jane Austen's *Persuasion* as your source of text. Then you'll develop another bot using *ChatterBot*, a chatbot development library in the Python ecosystem. After these, you'll use a larger corpus to build a more capable chatbot using ChatterBot."

       "['Sir Walter Elliot, of Kellynch Hall, in Somersetshire, was a man who, for his own amusement, never took up any book but the Baronetage; there he found occupation for an idle hour, and consolation in a distressed one; there his faculties were roused into admiration and respect, by contemplating the limited remnant of the earliest patents; there any unwelcome sensations, arising from domestic affairs changed naturally into pity and contempt as he turned over the almost endless creations of the last century; and there, if every other leaf were powerless, he could read his own history with an interest which never failed.',\n",
       " 'This was the page at which the favourite volume always opened: \"ELLIOT OF KELLYNCH HALL.',\n",
       " 'Walter Elliot, born March , , married, July , , Elizabeth, daughter of James Stevenson, Esq. of South Park, in the county of Gloucester, by which lady (who died ) he has issue Elizabeth, born June , ;',\n",
       " 'Anne, born August , ; a still-born son, November , ; Mary, born November , .',\n",
       " 'Precisely such had the paragraph originally stood from the printer\\'s hands; but Sir Walter had improved it by adding, for the information of himself and his family, these words, after the date of Mary\\'s birth \"Married, December , , Charles, son and heir of Charles Musgrove, Esq. of Uppercross, in the county of Somerset,\" and by inserting most accurately the day of the month on which he had lost his wife.',\n",
       " 'Then followed the history and rise of the ancient and respectable family, in the usual terms; how it had been first settled in Cheshire; how mentioned in Dugdale, serving the office of high sheriff, representing a borough in three successive parliaments, exertions of loyalty, and dignity of baronet, in the first year of Charles II, with all the Marys and Elizabeths they had married; forming altogether two handsome duodecimo pages, and concluding with the arms and motto: \"Principal seat, Kellynch Hall, in the county of Somerset,\" and Sir Walter\\'s handwriting again in this finale: \"Heir presumptive, William Walter Elliot, Esq., great grandson of the second Sir Walter.',\n",
       " \"Vanity was the beginning and the end of Sir Walter Elliot's character; vanity of person and of situation.\",\n",
       " 'He had been remarkably handsome in his youth; and, at fifty-four, was still a very fine man.',\n",
       " 'Few women could think more of their personal appearance than he did, nor could the valet of any new made lord be more delighted with the place he held in society.',\n",
       " 'He considered the blessing of beauty as inferior only to the blessing of a baronetcy; and the Sir Walter Elliot, who united these gifts, was the constant object of his warmest respect and devotion.',\n",
       " 'His good looks and his rank had one fair claim on his attachment; since to them he must have owed a wife of very superior character to any thing deserved by his own.',\n",
       " 'Lady Elliot had been an excellent woman, sensible and amiable; whose judgement and conduct, if they might be pardoned the youthful infatuation which made her Lady Elliot, had never required indulgence afterwards.',\n",
       " 'She had humoured, or softened, or concealed his failings, and promoted his real respectability for seventeen years; and though not the very happiest being in the world herself, had found enough in her duties, her friends, and her children, to attach her to life, and make it no matter of indifference to her when she was called on to quit them.',\n",
       " 'Three girls, the two eldest sixteen and fourteen, was an awful legacy for a mother to bequeath, an awful charge rather, to confide to the authority and guidance of a conceited, silly father.',\n",
       " 'She had, however, one very intimate friend, a sensible, deserving woman, who had been brought, by strong attachment to herself, to settle close by her, in the village of Kellynch; and on her kindness and advice, Lady Elliot mainly relied for the best help and maintenance of the good principles and instruction which she had been anxiously giving her daughters.',\n",
       " 'This friend, and Sir Walter, did not marry, whatever might have been anticipated on that head by their acquaintance.',\n",
       " \"Thirteen years had passed away since Lady Elliot's death, and they were still near neighbours and intimate friends, and one remained a widower, the other a widow.\",\n",
       " \"That Lady Russell, of steady age and character, and extremely well provided for, should have no thought of a second marriage, needs no apology to the public, which is rather apt to be unreasonably discontented when a woman does marry again, than when she does not; but Sir Walter's continuing in singleness requires explanation.\",\n",
       " \"Be it known then, that Sir Walter, like a good father, (having met with one or two private disappointments in very unreasonable applications), prided himself on remaining single for his dear daughters' sake.\",\n",
       " 'For one daughter, his eldest, he would really have given up any thing, which he had not been very much tempted to do.',\n",
       " \"Elizabeth had succeeded, at sixteen, to all that was possible, of her mother's rights and consequence; and being very handsome, and very like himself, her influence had always been great, and they had gone on together most happily.\",\n",
       " 'His two other children were of very inferior value.',\n",
       " 'Mary had acquired a little artificial importance, by becoming Mrs Charles Musgrove; but Anne, with an elegance of mind and sweetness of character, which must have placed her high with any people of real understanding, was nobody with either father or sister; her word had no weight, her convenience was always to give way she was only Anne.',\n",
       " 'To Lady Russell, indeed, she was a most dear and highly valued god-daughter, favourite, and friend.',\n",
       " 'Lady Russell loved them all; but it was only in Anne that she could fancy the mother to revive again.',\n",
       " 'A few years before, Anne Elliot had been a very pretty girl, but her bloom had vanished early; and as even in its height, her father had found little to admire in her, (so totally different were her delicate features and mild dark eyes from his own), there could be nothing in them, now that she was faded and thin, to excite his esteem.',\n",
       " 'He had never indulged much hope, he had now none, of ever reading her name in any other page of his favourite work.',\n",
       " 'All equality of alliance must rest with Elizabeth, for Mary had merely connected herself with an old country family of respectability and large fortune, and had therefore given all the honour and received none: Elizabeth would, one day or other, marry suitably.',\n",
       " 'It sometimes happens that a woman is handsomer at twenty-nine than she was ten years before; and, generally speaking, if there has been neither ill health nor anxiety, it is a time of life at which scarcely any charm is lost.',\n",
       " 'It was so with Elizabeth, still the same handsome Miss Elliot that she had begun to be thirteen years ago, and Sir Walter might be excused, therefore, in forgetting her age, or, at least, be deemed only half a fool, for thinking himself and Elizabeth as blooming as ever, amidst the wreck of the good looks of everybody else',\n",
       " '; for he could plainly see how old all the rest of his family and acquaintance were growing.',\n",
       " \"Anne haggard, Mary coarse, every face in the neighbourhood worsting, and the rapid increase of the crow's foot about Lady Russell's temples had long been a distress to him.\",\n",
       " 'Elizabeth did not quite equal her father in personal contentment.',\n",
       " 'Thirteen years had seen her mistress of Kellynch Hall, presiding and directing with a self-possession and decision which could never have given the idea of her being younger than she was.',\n",
       " 'For thirteen years had she been doing the honours, and laying down the domestic law at home, and leading the way to the chaise and four, and walking immediately after Lady Russell out of all the drawing-rooms and dining-rooms in the country.',\n",
       " \"Thirteen winters' revolving frosts had seen her opening every ball of credit which a scanty neighbourhood afforded, and thirteen springs shewn their blossoms, as she travelled up to London with her father, for a few weeks' annual enjoyment of the great world.\",\n",
       " 'She had the remembrance of all this, she had the consciousness of being nine-and-twenty to give her some regrets and some apprehensions; she was fully satisfied of being still quite as handsome as ever, but she felt her approach to the years of danger, and would have rejoiced to be certain of being properly solicited by baronet-blood within the next twelvemonth or two.',\n",
       " 'Then might she again take up the book of books with as much enjoyment as in her early youth, but now she liked it not.',\n",
       " 'Always to be presented with the date of her own birth and see no marriage follow but that of a youngest sister, made the book an evil; and more than once,',\n",
       " 'when her father had left it open on the table near her, had she closed it, with averted eyes, and pushed it away.',\n",
       " 'She had had a disappointment, moreover, which that book, and especially the history of her own family, must ever present the remembrance of.',\n",
       " 'The heir presumptive, the very William Walter Elliot, Esq., whose rights had been so generously supported by her father, had disappointed her.',\n",
       " 'She had, while a very young girl, as soon as she had known him to be, in the event of her having no brother, the future baronet, meant to marry him, and her father had always meant that she should.',\n",
       " \"He had not been known to them as a boy; but soon after Lady Elliot's death, Sir Walter had sought the acquaintance, and though his overtures had not been met with any warmth, he had persevered in seeking it, making allowance for the modest drawing-back of youth; and, in one of their spring excursions to London, when Elizabeth was in her first bloom, Mr Elliot had been forced into the introduction.\",\n",
       " 'He was at that time a very young man, just engaged in the study of the law; and Elizabeth found him extremely agreeable, and every plan in his favour was confirmed.',\n",
       " 'He was invited to Kellynch Hall; he was talked of and expected all the rest of the year; but he never came.',\n",
       " 'The following spring he was seen again in town, found equally agreeable, again encouraged, invited, and expected, and again he did not come; and the next tidings were that he was married.',\n",
       " 'Instead of pushing his fortune in the line marked out for the heir of the house of Elliot, he had purchased independence by uniting himself to a rich woman of inferior birth.',\n",
       " 'Sir Walter has resented it.',\n",
       " 'As the head of the house, he felt that he ought to have been consulted, especially after taking the young man so publicly by the hand; \"For they must have been seen together,\" he observed, \"once at Tattersall\\'s, and twice in the lobby of the House of Commons.',\n",
       " 'His disapprobation was expressed, but apparently very little regarded.',\n",
       " 'Mr Elliot had attempted no apology, and shewn himself as unsolicitous of being longer noticed by the family, as Sir Walter considered him unworthy of it: all acquaintance between them had ceased.',\n",
       " \"This very awkward history of Mr Elliot was still, after an interval of several years, felt with anger by Elizabeth, who had liked the man for himself, and still more for being her father's heir, and whose strong family pride could see only in him a proper match for Sir Walter Elliot's eldest daughter.\",\n",
       " 'There was not a baronet from A to Z whom her feelings could have so willingly acknowledged as an equal.',\n",
       " 'Yet so miserably had he conducted himself, that though she was at this present time (the summer of ) wearing black ribbons for his wife, she could not admit him to be worth thinking of again.',\n",
       " 'The disgrace of his first marriage might, perhaps, as there was no reason to suppose it perpetuated by offspring, have been got over, had he not done worse; but he had, as by the accustomary intervention of kind friends, they had been informed, spoken most disrespectfully of them all, most slightingly and contemptuously of the very blood he belonged to, and the honours which were hereafter to be his own.',\n",
       " 'This could not be pardoned.',\n",
       " \"Such were Elizabeth Elliot's sentiments and sensations; such the cares to alloy, the agitations to vary, the sameness and the elegance, the prosperity and the nothingness of her scene of life; such the feelings to give interest to a long, uneventful residence in one country circle, to fill the vacancies which there were no habits of utility abroad, no talents or accomplishments for home, to occupy.\",\n",
       " 'But now, another occupation and solicitude of mind was beginning to be added to these.',\n",
       " 'Her father was growing distressed for money.',\n",
       " 'She knew, that when he now took up the Baronetage, it was to drive the heavy bills of his tradespeople, and the unwelcome hints of Mr Shepherd, his agent, from his thoughts.',\n",
       " \"The Kellynch property was good, but not equal to Sir Walter's apprehension of the state required in its possessor.\",\n",
       " 'While Lady Elliot lived, there had been method, moderation, and economy, which had just kept him within his income; but with her had died all such right-mindedness, and from that period he had been constantly exceeding it.',\n",
       " 'It had not been possible for him to spend less; he had done nothing but what Sir Walter Elliot was imperiously called on to do; but blameless as he was, he was not only growing dreadfully in debt, but was hearing of it so often, that it became vain to attempt concealing it longer, even partially, from his daughter.',\n",
       " 'He had given her some hints of it the last spring in town; he had gone so far even as to say, \"Can we retrench?',\n",
       " 'Does it occur to you that there is any one article in which we can retrench?\" and Elizabeth, to do her justice, had, in the first ardour of female alarm, set seriously to think what could be done, and had finally proposed these two branches of economy, to cut off some unnecessary charities, and to refrain from new furnishing the drawing-room; to which expedients she afterwards added the happy thought of their taking no present down to Anne, as had been the usual yearly custom.',\n",
       " 'But these measures, however good in themselves, were insufficient for the real extent of the evil, the whole of which Sir Walter found himself obliged to confess to her soon afterwards.',\n",
       " 'Elizabeth had nothing to propose of deeper efficacy.',\n",
       " 'She felt herself ill-used and unfortunate, as did her father; and they were neither of them able to devise any means of lessening their expenses without compromising their dignity, or relinquishing their comforts in a way not to be borne.',\n",
       " 'There was only a small part of his estate that Sir Walter could dispose of; but had every acre been alienable, it would have made no difference.',\n",
       " 'He had condescended to mortgage as far as he had the power, but he would never condescend to sell.',\n",
       " 'No; he would never disgrace his name so far.',\n",
       " 'The Kellynch estate should be transmitted whole and entire, as he had received it.',\n",
       " 'Their two confidential friends, Mr Shepherd, who lived in the neighbouring market town, and Lady Russell, were called to advise them; and both father and daughter seemed to expect that something should be struck out by one or the other to remove their embarrassments and reduce their expenditure, without involving the loss of any indulgence of taste or pride.',\n",
       " 'Mr Shepherd, a civil, cautious lawyer, who, whatever might be his hold or his views on Sir Walter, would rather have the disagreeable prompted by anybody else, excused himself from offering the slightest hint, and only begged leave to recommend an implicit reference to the excellent judgement of Lady Russell, from whose known good sense he fully expected to have just such resolute measures advised as he meant to see finally adopted.',\n",
       " 'Lady Russell was most anxiously zealous on the subject, and gave it much serious consideration.',\n",
       " 'She was a woman rather of sound than of quick abilities, whose difficulties in coming to any decision in this instance were great, from the opposition of two leading principles.',\n",
       " \"She was of strict integrity herself, with a delicate sense of honour; but she was as desirous of saving Sir Walter's feelings, as solicitous for the credit of the family, as aristocratic in her ideas of what was due to them, as anybody of sense and honesty could well be.\",\n",
       " 'She was a benevolent, charitable, good woman, and capable of strong attachments, most correct in her conduct, strict in her notions of decorum, and with manners that were held a standard of good-breeding.',\n",
       " 'She had a cultivated mind, and was, generally speaking, rational and consistent; but she had prejudices on the side of ancestry; she had a value for rank and consequence, which blinded her a little to the faults of those who possessed them.',\n",
       " 'Herself the widow of only a knight, she gave the dignity of a baronet all its due; and Sir Walter, independent of his claims as an old acquaintance, an attentive neighbour, an obliging landlord, the husband of her very dear friend, the father of Anne and her sisters, was, as being Sir Walter, in her apprehension, entitled to a great deal of compassion and consideration under his present difficulties.',\n",
       " 'They must retrench; that did not admit of a doubt.',\n",
       " 'But she was very anxious to have it done with the least possible pain to him and Elizabeth.',\n",
       " 'She drew up plans of economy, she made exact calculations, and she did what nobody else thought of doing',\n",
       " ': she consulted Anne, who never seemed considered by the others as having any interest in the question.',\n",
       " 'She consulted, and in a degree was influenced by her in marking out the scheme of retrenchment which was at last submitted to Sir Walter.',\n",
       " \"Every emendation of Anne's had been on the side of honesty against importance.\",\n",
       " 'She wanted more vigorous measures, a more complete reformation, a quicker release from debt, a much higher tone of indifference for everything but justice and equity.',\n",
       " 'If we can persuade your father to all this,\" said Lady Russell, looking over her paper, \"much may be done.',\n",
       " 'If he will adopt these regulations, in seven years he will be clear; and I hope we may be able to convince him and Elizabeth, that Kellynch Hall has a respectability in itself which cannot be affected by these reductions; and that the true dignity of Sir Walter Elliot will be very far from lessened in the eyes of sensible people, by acting like a man of principle.',\n",
       " 'What will he be doing, in fact, but what very many of our first families have done, or ought to do?',\n",
       " 'There will be nothing singular in his case; and it is singularity which often makes the worst part of our suffering, as it always does of our conduct.',\n",
       " 'I have great hope of prevailing.',\n",
       " 'We must be serious and decided; for after all, the person who has contracted debts must pay them; and though a great deal is due to the feelings of the gentleman, and the head of a house, like your father, there is still more due to the character of an honest man.',\n",
       " 'This was the principle on which Anne wanted her father to be proceeding, his friends to be urging him.',\n",
       " 'She considered it as an act of indispensable duty to clear away the claims of creditors with all the expedition which the most comprehensive retrenchments could secure, and saw no dignity in anything short of it.',\n",
       " 'She wanted it to be prescribed, and felt as a duty.',\n",
       " \"She rated Lady Russell's influence highly; and as to the severe degree of self-denial which her own conscience prompted, she believed there might be little more difficulty in persuading them to a complete, than to half a reformation.\",\n",
       " \"Her knowledge of her father and Elizabeth inclined her to think that the sacrifice of one pair of horses would be hardly less painful than of both, and so on, through the whole list of Lady Russell's too gentle reductions.\",\n",
       " \"How Anne's more rigid requisitions might have been taken is of little consequence.\",\n",
       " \"Lady Russell's had no success at all: could not be put up with, were not to be borne.\",\n",
       " '\"What! every comfort of life knocked off!',\n",
       " 'Journeys, London, servants, horses, table contractions and restrictions every where!',\n",
       " 'To live no longer with the decencies even of a private gentleman!',\n",

       " 'More than seven years were gone since this little history of sorrowful interest had reached its close; and time had softened down much, perhaps nearly all of peculiar attachment to him, but she had been too dependent on time alone; no aid had been given in change of place (except in one visit to Bath soon after the rupture), or in any novelty or enlargement of society.',\n",
       " 'No one had ever come within the Kellynch circle, who could bear a comparison with Frederick Wentworth, as he stood in her memory.',\n",
       " 'No second attachment, the only thoroughly natural, happy, and sufficient cure, at her time of life, had been possible to the nice tone of her mind, the fastidiousness of her taste, in the small limits of the society around them.',\n",
       " \"She had been solicited, when about two-and-twenty, to change her name, by the young man, who not long afterwards found a more willing mind in her younger sister; and Lady Russell had lamented her refusal; for Charles Musgrove was the eldest son of a man, whose landed property and general importance were second in that country, only to Sir Walter's, and of good character and appearance; and however Lady Russell might have asked yet for something more, while Anne was nineteen, she would have rejoiced to see her at twenty-two so respectably removed from the partialities and injustice of her father's house, and settled so permanently near herself.\",\n",
       " \"But in this case, Anne had left nothing for advice to do; and though Lady Russell, as satisfied as ever with her own discretion, never wished the past undone, she began now to have the anxiety which borders on hopelessness for Anne's being tempted, by some man of talents and independence, to enter a state for which she held her to be peculiarly fitted by her warm affections and domestic habits.\",\n",
       " \"They knew not each other's opinion, either its constancy or its change, on the one leading point of Anne's conduct, for the subject was never alluded to; but Anne, at seven-and-twenty, thought very differently from what she had been made to think at nineteen.\",\n",
       " 'She did not blame Lady Russell, she did not blame herself for having been guided by her; but she felt that were any young person, in similar circumstances, to apply to her for counsel, they would never receive any of such certain immediate wretchedness, such uncertain future good.',\n",
       " 'She was persuaded that under every disadvantage of disapprobation at home, and every anxiety attending his profession, all their probable fears, delays, and disappointments, she should yet have been a happier woman in maintaining the engagement, than she had been in the sacrifice of it; and this, she fully believed, had the usual share, had even more than the usual share of all such solicitudes and suspense been theirs, without reference to the actual results of their case, which, as it happened, would have bestowed earlier prosperity than could be reasonably calculated on.',\n",
       " 'All his sanguine expectations, all his confidence had been justified.',\n",
       " 'His genius and ardour had seemed to foresee and to command his prosperous path.',\n",
       " 'He had, very soon after their engagement ceased, got employ: and all that he had told her would follow, had taken place.',\n",
       " 'He had distinguished himself, and early gained the other step in rank, and must now, by successive captures, have made a handsome fortune.',\n",
       " 'She had only navy lists and newspapers for her authority, but she could not doubt his being rich; and, in favour of his constancy, she had no reason to believe him married.',\n",
       " 'How eloquent could Anne Elliot have been!',\n",
       " 'how eloquent, at least, were her wishes on the side of early warm attachment, and a cheerful confidence in futurity, against that over-anxious caution which seems to insult exertion and distrust Providence!',\n",
       " 'She had been forced into prudence in her youth, she learned romance as she grew older:',\n",
       " 'the natural sequel of an unnatural beginning.',\n",
       " \"With all these circumstances, recollections and feelings, she could not hear that Captain Wentworth's sister was likely to live at Kellynch without a revival of former pain; and many a stroll, and many a sigh, were necessary to dispel the agitation of the idea.\",\n",
       " 'She often told herself it was folly, before she could harden her nerves sufficiently to feel the continual discussion of the Crofts and their business no evil.',\n",
       " 'She was assisted, however, by that perfect indifference and apparent unconsciousness, among the only three of her own friends in the secret of the past, which seemed almost to deny any recollection of it.',\n",
       " \"She could do justice to the superiority of Lady Russell's motives in this, over those of her father and Elizabeth; she could honour all the better feelings of her calmness; but the general air of oblivion among them was highly important from whatever it sprung; and in the event of Admiral Croft's really taking Kellynch Hall, she rejoiced anew over the conviction which had always been most grateful to her, of the past being known to those three only among her connexions, by whom no syllable, she believed, would ever be whispered, and in the trust that among his, the brother only with whom he had been residing, had received any information of their short-lived engagement.\",\n",
       " \"That brother had been long removed from the country and being a sensible man, and, moreover, a single man at the time, she had a fond dependence on no human creature's having heard of it from him.\",\n",
       " 'The sister, Mrs Croft, had then been out of England, accompanying her husband on a foreign station, and her own sister, Mary, had been at school while it all occurred; and never admitted by the pride of some, and the delicacy of others, to the smallest knowledge of it afterwards.',\n",
       " 'With these supports, she hoped that the acquaintance between herself and the Crofts, which, with Lady Russell, still resident in Kellynch, and Mary fixed only three miles off, must be anticipated, need not involve any particular awkwardness.',\n",
       " \"On the morning appointed for Admiral and Mrs Croft's seeing Kellynch Hall, Anne found it most natural to take her almost daily walk to Lady Russell's, and keep out of the way till all was over; when she found it most natural to be sorry that she had missed the opportunity of seeing them.\",\n",
       " 'This meeting of the two parties proved highly satisfactory, and decided the whole business at once.',\n",
       " \"Each lady was previously well disposed for an agreement, and saw nothing, therefore, but good manners in the other; and with regard to the gentlemen, there was such an hearty good humour, such an open, trusting liberality on the Admiral's side, as could not but influence Sir Walter, who had besides been flattered into his very best and most polished behaviour by Mr Shepherd's assurances of his being known, by report, to the Admiral, as a model of good breeding.\",\n",
       " 'The house and grounds, and furniture, were approved, the Crofts were approved, terms, time, every thing, and every body, was right; and Mr Shepherd\\'s clerks were set to work, without there having been a single preliminary difference to modify of all that \"This indenture sheweth.',\n",
       " 'Sir Walter, without hesitation, declared the Admiral to be the best-looking sailor he had ever met with, and went so far as to say, that if his own man might have had the arranging of his hair, he should not be ashamed of being seen with him any where; and the Admiral, with sympathetic cordiality, observed to his wife as they drove back through the park, \"I thought we should soon come to a deal, my dear, in spite of what they told us at Taunton.',\n",
       " 'The Baronet will never set the Thames on fire, but there seems to be no harm in him.',\n",
       " '\" reciprocal compliments, which would have been esteemed about equal.',\n",
       " 'The Crofts were to have possession at Michaelmas; and as Sir Walter proposed removing to Bath in the course of the preceding month, there was no time to be lost in making every dependent arrangement.',\n",
       " 'Lady Russell, convinced that Anne would not be allowed to be of any use, or any importance, in the choice of the house which they were going to secure, was very unwilling to have her hurried away so soon, and wanted to make it possible for her to stay behind till she might convey her to Bath herself after Christmas; but having engagements of her own which must take her from Kellynch for several weeks, she was unable to give the full invitation she wished, and',\n",
       " 'Anne though dreading the possible heats of September in all the white glare of Bath, and grieving to forego all the influence so sweet and so sad of the autumnal months in the country, did not think that, everything considered, she wished to remain.',\n",
       " 'It would be most right, and most wise, and, therefore must involve least suffering to go with the others.',\n",
       " 'Something occurred, however, to give her a different duty.',\n",
       " \"Mary, often a little unwell, and always thinking a great deal of her own complaints, and always in the habit of claiming Anne when anything was the matter, was indisposed; and foreseeing that she should not have a day's health all the autumn, entreated, or rather required her, for it was hardly entreaty, to come to Uppercross Cottage, and bear her company as long as she should want her, instead of going to Bath.\",\n",
       " 'I cannot possibly do without Anne,\" was Mary\\'s reasoning; and Elizabeth\\'s reply was, \"Then I am sure Anne had better stay, for nobody will want her in Bath.',\n",
       " 'To be claimed as a good, though in an improper style, is at least better than being rejected as no good at all; and Anne, glad to be thought of some use, glad to have anything marked out as a duty, and certainly not sorry to have the scene of it in the country, and her own dear country, readily agreed to stay.',\n",
       " \"This invitation of Mary's removed all Lady Russell's difficulties, and it was consequently soon settled that Anne should not go to Bath till Lady Russell took her, and that all the intervening time should be divided between Uppercross Cottage and Kellynch Lodge.\",\n",
       " \"So far all was perfectly right; but Lady Russell was almost startled by the wrong of one part of the Kellynch Hall plan, when it burst on her, which was, Mrs Clay's being engaged to go to Bath with Sir Walter and Elizabeth, as a most important and valuable assistant to the latter in all the business before her.\",\n",
       " \"Lady Russell was extremely sorry that such a measure should have been resorted to at all, wondered, grieved, and feared; and the affront it contained to Anne, in Mrs Clay's being of so much use, while Anne could be of none, was a very sore aggravation.\",\n",
       " 'Anne herself was become hardened to such affronts; but she felt the imprudence of the arrangement quite as keenly as Lady Russell.',\n",
       " \"With a great deal of quiet observation, and a knowledge, which she often wished less, of her father's character, she was sensible that results the most serious to his family from the intimacy were more than possible.\",\n",
       " 'She did not imagine that her father had at present an idea of the kind.',\n",
       " 'Mrs Clay had freckles, and a projecting tooth, and a clumsy wrist, which he was continually making severe remarks upon, in her absence; but she was young, and certainly altogether well-looking, and possessed, in an acute mind and assiduous pleasing manners, infinitely more dangerous attractions than any merely personal',\n",
       " 'might have been.',\n",
       " 'Anne was so impressed by the degree of their danger, that she could not excuse herself from trying to make it perceptible to her sister.',\n",
       " 'She had little hope of success; but Elizabeth, who in the event of such a reverse would be so much more to be pitied than herself, should never, she thought, have reason to reproach her for giving no warning.',\n",
       " 'She spoke, and seemed only to offend.',\n",
       " \"Elizabeth could not conceive how such an absurd suspicion should occur to her, and indignantly answered for each party's perfectly knowing their situation.\",\n",
       " 'Mrs Clay,\" said she, warmly, \"never forgets who she is; and as I am rather better acquainted with her sentiments than you can be, I can assure you, that upon the subject of marriage they are particularly nice, and that she reprobates all inequality of condition and rank more strongly than most people.',\n",
       " 'And as to my father, I really should not have thought that he, who has kept himself single so long for our sakes, need be suspected now.',\n",
       " 'If Mrs Clay were a very beautiful woman, I grant you, it might be wrong to have her so much with me;',\n",
       " 'not that anything in the world, I am sure, would induce my father to make a degrading match, but he might be rendered unhappy.',\n",
       " 'But poor Mrs Clay who, with all her merits, can never have been reckoned tolerably pretty, I really think poor Mrs Clay may be staying here in perfect safety.',\n",

       " \"You must have heard him notice Mrs Clay's freckles.\",\n",
       " 'There is hardly any personal defect,\" replied Anne, \"which an agreeable manner might not gradually reconcile one to.\"',\n",
       " '\"I think very differently,\" answered Elizabeth, shortly; \"an agreeable manner may set off handsome features, but can never alter plain ones.',\n",
       " 'However, at any rate, as I have a great deal more at stake on this point than anybody else can have, I think it rather unnecessary in you to be advising me.',\n",
       " 'Anne had done; glad that it was over, and not absolutely hopeless of doing good.',\n",
       " 'Elizabeth, though resenting the suspicion, might yet be made observant by it.',\n",
       " 'The last office of the four carriage-horses was to draw Sir Walter, Miss Elliot, and Mrs Clay to Bath.',\n",
       " 'The party drove off in very good spirits; Sir Walter prepared with condescending bows for all the afflicted tenantry and cottagers who might have had a hint to show themselves, and Anne walked up at the same time, in a sort of desolate tranquillity, to the Lodge, where she was to spend the first week.',\n",
       " 'Her friend was not in better spirits than herself.',\n",
       " 'Lady Russell felt this break-up of the family exceedingly.',\n",
       " 'Their respectability was as dear to her as her own, and a daily intercourse had become precious by habit.',\n",
       " 'It was painful to look upon their deserted grounds, and still worse to anticipate the new hands they were to fall into; and to escape the solitariness and the melancholy of so altered a village, and be out of the way when Admiral and Mrs Croft first arrived, she had determined to make her own absence from home begin when she must give up Anne.',\n",
       " \"Accordingly their removal was made together, and Anne was set down at Uppercross Cottage, in the first stage of Lady Russell's journey.\",\n",
       " \"Uppercross was a moderate-sized village, which a few years back had been completely in the old English style, containing only two houses superior in appearance to those of the yeomen and labourers; the mansion of the squire, with its high walls, great gates, and old trees, substantial and unmodernized, and the compact, tight parsonage, enclosed in its own neat garden, with a vine and a pear-tree trained round its casements; but upon the marriage of the young 'squire, it had received the improvement of a farm-house elevated into a cottage, for his residence, and Uppercross Cottage, with its veranda, French windows, and other prettiness, was quite as likely to catch the traveller's eye as the more consistent and considerable aspect and premises of the Great House, about a quarter of a mile farther on.\",\n",
       " 'Here Anne had often been staying.',\n",
       " 'She knew the ways of Uppercross as well as those of Kellynch.',\n",
       " \"The two families were so continually meeting, so much in the habit of running in and out of each other's house at all hours, that it was rather a surprise to her to find Mary alone; but being alone, her being unwell and out of spirits was almost a matter of course.\",\n",
       " \"Though better endowed than the elder sister, Mary had not Anne's understanding nor temper.\",\n",
       " 'While well, and happy, and properly attended to, she had great good humour and excellent spirits; but any indisposition sunk her completely.',\n",
       " 'She had no resources for solitude; and inheriting a considerable share of the Elliot self-importance, was very prone to add to every other distress that of fancying herself neglected and ill-used.',\n",
       " 'In person, she was inferior to both sisters, and had, even in her bloom, only reached the dignity of being \"a fine girl.',\n",
       " 'She was now lying on the faded sofa of the pretty little drawing-room, the once elegant furniture of which had been gradually growing shabby, under the influence of four summers and two children; and, on Anne\\'s appearing, greeted her with \"So, you are come at last!',\n",
       " 'I began to think I should never see you.',\n",
       " 'I am so ill I can hardly speak.',\n",
       " 'I have not seen a creature the whole morning!\"',\n",
       " '\"I am sorry to find you unwell,\" replied Anne.',\n",
       " 'You sent me such a good account of yourself on Thursday!\"',\n",
       " '\"Yes, I made the best of it; I always do: but I was very far from well at the time; and I do not think I ever was so ill in my life as I have been all this morning: very unfit to be left alone, I am sure.',\n",

       " 'She was always on friendly terms with her brother-in-law; and in the children, who loved her nearly as well, and respected her a great deal more than their mother, she had an object of interest, amusement, and wholesome exertion.',\n",
       " 'Charles Musgrove was civil and agreeable; in sense and temper he was undoubtedly superior to his wife, but not of powers, or conversation, or grace, to make the past, as they were connected together, at all a dangerous contemplation; though, at the same time, Anne could believe, with Lady Russell, that a more equal match might have greatly improved him; and that a woman of real understanding might have given more consequence to his character, and more usefulness, rationality, and elegance to his habits and pursuits.',\n",
       " 'As it was, he did nothing with much zeal, but sport; and his time was otherwise trifled away, without benefit from books or anything else.',\n",
       " \"He had very good spirits, which never seemed much affected by his wife's occasional lowness, bore with her unreasonableness sometimes to Anne's admiration, and upon the whole, though there was very often a little disagreement (in which she had sometimes more share than she wished, being appealed to by both parties), they might pass for a happy couple.\",\n",
       " \"They were always perfectly agreed in the want of more money, and a strong inclination for a handsome present from his father; but here, as on most topics, he had the superiority, for while Mary thought it a great shame that such a present was not made, he always contended for his father's having many other uses for his money, and a right to spend it as he liked.\",\n",
       " \"As to the management of their children, his theory was much better than his wife's, and his practice not so bad.\",\n",
       " 'I could manage them very well, if it were not for Mary\\'s interference,\" was what Anne often heard him say, and had a good deal of faith in; but when listening in turn to Mary\\'s reproach of \"Charles spoils the children so that I cannot get them into any order,\" she never had the smallest temptation to say, \"Very true.',\n",
       " 'One of the least agreeable circumstances of her residence there was her being treated with too much confidence by all parties, and being too much in the secret of the complaints of each house.',\n",

       " 'She had this communication, moreover, from Mary.',\n",
       " 'Mrs Musgrove thinks all her servants so steady, that it would be high treason to call it in question; but I am sure, without exaggeration, that her upper house-maid and laundry-maid, instead of being in their business, are gadding about the village, all day long.',\n",

       " \"Again, it was Mary's complaint, that Mrs Musgrove was very apt not to give her the precedence that was her due, when they dined at the Great House with other families; and she did not see any reason why she was to be considered so much at home as to lose her place.\",\n",
       " 'And one day when Anne was walking with only the Musgroves, one of them after talking of rank, people of rank, and jealousy of rank, said, \"I have no scruple of observing to you, how nonsensical some persons are about their place, because all the world knows how easy and indifferent you are about it; but I wish anybody could give Mary a hint that it would be a great deal better if she were not so very tenacious, especially if she would not be always putting herself forward to take place of mamma.',\n",
       " 'Nobody doubts her right to have precedence of mamma, but it would be more becoming in her not to be always insisting on it.',\n",
       " 'It is not that mamma cares about it the least in the world, but I know it is taken notice of by many persons.',\n",
       " 'How was Anne to set all these matters to rights?',\n",
       " \"She could do little more than listen patiently, soften every grievance, and excuse each to the other; give them all hints of the forbearance necessary between such near neighbours, and make those hints broadest which were meant for her sister's benefit.\",\n",
       " 'In all other respects, her visit began and proceeded very well.',\n",
       " \"Her own spirits improved by change of place and subject, by being removed three miles from Kellynch; Mary's ailments lessened by having a constant companion, and their daily intercourse with the other family, since there was neither superior affection, confidence, nor employment in the cottage, to be interrupted by it, was rather an advantage.\",\n",
       " \"It was certainly carried nearly as far as possible, for they met every morning, and hardly ever spent an evening asunder; but she believed they should not have done so well without the sight of Mr and Mrs Musgrove's respectable forms in the usual places, or without the talking, laughing, and singing of their daughters.\",\n",
       " 'She played a great deal better than either of the Miss Musgroves, but having no voice, no knowledge of the harp, and no fond parents, to sit by and fancy themselves delighted, her performance was little thought of, only out of civility, or to refresh the others, as she was well aware.',\n",
       " 'She knew that when she played she was giving pleasure only to herself; but this was no new sensation.',\n",
       " 'Excepting one short period of her life, she had never, since the age of fourteen, never since the loss of her dear mother, known the happiness of being listened to, or encouraged by any just appreciation or real taste.',\n",
       " \"In music she had been always used to feel alone in the world; and Mr and Mrs Musgrove's fond partiality for their own daughters' performance, and total indifference to any other person's, gave her much more pleasure for their sakes, than mortification for her own.\",\n",
       " 'The party at the Great House was sometimes increased by other company.',\n",
       " 'The neighbourhood was not large, but the Musgroves were visited by everybody, and had more dinner-parties, and more callers, more visitors by invitation and by chance, than any other family.',\n",
       " 'There were more completely popular.',\n",
       " 'The girls were wild for dancing; and the evenings ended, occasionally, in an unpremeditated little ball.',\n",
       " 'There was a family of cousins within a walk of Uppercross, in less affluent circumstances, who depended on the Musgroves for all their pleasures: they would come at any time, and help play at anything, or dance anywhere; and Anne, very much preferring the office of musician to a more active post, played country dances to them by the hour together; a kindness which always recommended her musical powers to the notice of Mr and Mrs Musgrove more than anything else, and often drew this compliment; \"Well done, Miss Anne!',\n",
       " 'very well done indeed!',\n",

       " 'Anne had very sincerely rejoiced in there being no means of her going.',\n",
       " 'She wished, however to see the Crofts, and was glad to be within when the visit was returned.',\n",
       " 'They came: the master of the house was not at home, but the two sisters were together; and as it chanced that Mrs Croft fell to the share of Anne, while the Admiral sat by Mary, and made himself very agreeable by his good-humoured notice of her little boys, she was well able to watch for a likeness, and if it failed her in the features, to catch it in the voice, or in the turn of sentiment and expression.',\n",
       " 'Mrs Croft, though neither tall nor fat, had a squareness, uprightness, and vigour of form, which gave importance to her person.',\n",
       " 'She had bright dark eyes, good teeth, and altogether an agreeable face; though her reddened and weather-beaten complexion, the consequence of her having been almost as much at sea as her husband, made her seem to have lived some years longer in the world than her real eight-and-thirty.',\n",
       " 'Her manners were open, easy, and decided, like one who had no distrust of herself, and no doubts of what to do; without any approach to coarseness, however, or any want of good humour.',\n",
       " \"Anne gave her credit, indeed, for feelings of great consideration towards herself, in all that related to Kellynch, and it pleased her: especially, as she had satisfied herself in the very first half minute, in the instant even of introduction, that there was not the smallest symptom of any knowledge or suspicion on Mrs Croft's side, to give a bias of any sort.\",\n",
       " 'She was quite easy on that head, and consequently full of strength and courage, till for a moment electrified by Mrs Croft\\'s suddenly saying, \"It was you, and not your sister, I find, that my brother had the pleasure of being acquainted with, when he was in this country.',\n",
       " 'Anne hoped she had outlived the age of blushing; but the age of emotion she certainly had not.',\n",
       " 'Perhaps you may not have heard that he is married?\" added Mrs Croft.',\n",
       " \"She could now answer as she ought; and was happy to feel, when Mrs Croft's next words explained it to be Mr Wentworth of whom she spoke, that she had said nothing which might not do for either brother.\",\n",
       " \"She immediately felt how reasonable it was, that Mrs Croft should be thinking and speaking of Edward, and not of Frederick; and with shame at her own forgetfulness applied herself to the knowledge of their former neighbour's present state with proper interest.\",\n",
       " 'The rest was all tranquillity; till, just as they were moving, she heard the Admiral say to Mary',\n",
       " '\"We are expecting a brother of Mrs Croft\\'s here soon; I dare say you know him by name.',\n",
       " 'He was cut short by the eager attacks of the little boys, clinging to him like an old friend, and declaring he should not go; and being too much engrossed by proposals of carrying them away in his coat pockets, &c., to have another moment for finishing or recollecting what he had begun, Anne was left to persuade herself, as well as she could, that the same brother must still be in question.',\n",
       " 'She could not, however, reach such a degree of certainty, as not to be anxious to hear whether anything had been said on the subject at the other house, where the Crofts had previously been calling.',\n",
       " 'The folks of the Great House were to spend the evening of this day at the Cottage; and it being now too late in the year for such visits to be made on foot, the coach was beginning to be listened for, when the youngest Miss Musgrove walked in.',\n",
       " 'That she was coming to apologize, and that they should have to spend the evening by themselves, was the first black idea; and Mary was quite ready to be affronted, when Louisa made all right by saying, that she only came on foot, to leave more room for the harp, which was bringing in the carriage.',\n",
       " 'And I will tell you our reason,\" she added, \"and all about it.',\n",
       " 'I am come on to give you notice, that papa and mamma are out of spirits this evening, especially mamma; she is thinking so much of poor Richard!',\n",

       " \"When the Crofts called this morning, (they called here afterwards, did not they?), they happened to say, that her brother, Captain Wentworth, is just returned to England, or paid off, or something, and is coming to see them almost directly; and most unluckily it came into mamma's head, when they were gone, that Wentworth, or something very like it, was the name of poor Richard's captain at one time\",\n",
       " '; I do not know when or where, but a great while before he died, poor fellow!',\n",
       " 'And upon looking over his letters and things, she found it was so, and is perfectly sure that this must be the very man, and her head is quite full of it, and of poor Richard!',\n",
       " 'So we must be as merry as we can, that she may not be dwelling upon such gloomy things.',\n",
       " 'The real circumstances of this pathetic piece of family history were, that the Musgroves had had the ill fortune of a very troublesome, hopeless son; and the good fortune to lose him before he reached his twentieth year; that he had been sent to sea because he was stupid and unmanageable on shore; that he had been very little cared for at any time by his family, though quite as much as he deserved; seldom heard of, and scarcely at all regretted, when the intelligence of his death abroad had worked its way to Uppercross, two years before.',\n",
       " 'He had, in fact, though his sisters were now doing all they could for him, by calling him \"poor Richard,\" been nothing better than a thick-headed, unfeeling, unprofitable Dick Musgrove, who had never done anything to entitle himself to more than the abbreviation of his name, living or dead.',\n",
       " \"He had been several years at sea, and had, in the course of those removals to which all midshipmen are liable, and especially such midshipmen as every captain wishes to get rid of, been six months on board Captain Frederick Wentworth's frigate, the Laconia; and from the Laconia he had, under the influence of his captain, written the only two letters which his father and mother had ever received from him during the whole of his absence; that is to say, the only two disinterested letters; all the rest had been mere applications for money.\",\n",
       " 'In each letter he had spoken well of his captain; but yet, so little were they in the habit of attending to such matters, so unobservant and incurious were they as to the names of men or ships, that it had made scarcely any impression at the time; and that Mrs Musgrove should have been suddenly struck, this very day, with a recollection of the name of Wentworth, as connected with her son, seemed one of those extraordinary bursts of mind which do sometimes occur.',\n",
       " 'She had gone to her letters, and found it all as she supposed; and the re-perusal of these letters, after so long an interval, her poor son gone for ever, and all the strength of his faults forgotten, had affected her spirits exceedingly, and thrown her into greater grief for him than she had know on first hearing of his death.',\n",
       " 'Mr Musgrove was, in a lesser degree, affected likewise; and when they reached the cottage, they were evidently in want, first, of being listened to anew on this subject, and afterwards, of all the relief which cheerful companions could give them.',\n",
       " \"To hear them talking so much of Captain Wentworth, repeating his name so often, puzzling over past years, and at last ascertaining that it might, that it probably would, turn out to be the very same Captain Wentworth whom they recollected meeting, once or twice, after their coming back from Clifton a very fine young man but they could not say whether it was seven or eight years ago, was a new sort of trial to Anne's nerves.\",\n",
       " 'She found, however, that it was one to which she must inure herself.',\n",
       " 'Since he actually was expected in the country, she must teach herself to be insensible on such points.',\n",
       " 'And not only did it appear that he was expected, and speedily, but the Musgroves, in their warm gratitude for the kindness he had shewn poor Dick, and very high respect for his character, stamped as it was by poor Dick\\'s having been six months under his care, and mentioning him in strong, though not perfectly well-spelt praise, as \"a fine dashing felow, only two perticular about the schoolmaster,\" were bent on introducing themselves, and seeking his acquaintance, as soon as they could hear of his arrival.',\n",
       " 'The resolution of doing so helped to form the comfort of their evening.',\n",
       " 'A very few days more, and Captain Wentworth was known to be at Kellynch, and Mr Musgrove had called on him, and come back warm in his praise, and he was engaged with the Crofts to dine at Uppercross, by the end of another week.',\n",
       " 'It had been a great disappointment to Mr Musgrove to find that no earlier day could be fixed, so impatient was he to shew his gratitude, by seeing Captain Wentworth under his own roof, and welcoming him to all that was strongest and best in his cellars.',\n",
       " \"But a week must pass; only a week, in Anne's reckoning, and then, she supposed, they must meet; and soon she began to wish that she could feel secure even for a week.\",\n",
       " \"Captain Wentworth made a very early return to Mr Musgrove's civility, and she was all but calling there in the same half hour.\",\n",
       " \"She and Mary were actually setting forward for the Great House, where, as she afterwards learnt, they must inevitably have found him, when they were stopped by the eldest boy's being at that moment brought home in consequence of a bad fall.\",\n",

       " 'It was an afternoon of distress, and Anne had every thing to do at once; the apothecary to send for, the father to have pursued and informed, the mother to support and keep from hysterics, the servants to control, the youngest child to banish, and the poor suffering one to attend and soothe; besides sending, as soon as she recollected it, proper notice to the other house, which brought her an accession rather of frightened, enquiring companions, than of very useful assistants.',\n",
       " \"Her brother's return was the first comfort; he could take best care of his wife; and the second blessing was the arrival of the apothecary.\",\n",
       " \"Till he came and had examined the child, their apprehensions were the worse for being vague; they suspected great injury, but knew not where; but now the collar-bone was soon replaced, and though Mr Robinson felt and felt, and rubbed, and looked grave, and spoke low words both to the father and the aunt, still they were all to hope the best, and to be able to part and eat their dinner in tolerable ease of mind; and then it was, just before they parted, that the two young aunts were able so far to digress from their nephew's state, as to give the information of Captain Wentworth's visit; staying five minutes behind their father and mother, to endeavour to express how perfectly delighted they were with him,\",\n",
       " 'how much handsomer, how infinitely more agreeable they thought him than any individual among their male acquaintance, who had been at all a favourite before.',\n",
       " \"How glad they had been to hear papa invite him to stay dinner, how sorry when he said it was quite out of his power, and how glad again when he had promised in reply to papa and mamma's farther pressing invitations to come and dine with them on the morrow actually on the morrow; and he had promised it in so pleasant a manner, as if he felt all the motive of their attention just as he ought.\",\n",
       " 'And in short, he had looked and said everything with such exquisite grace, that they could assure them all, their heads were both turned by him; and off they ran, quite as full of glee as of love, and apparently more full of Captain Wentworth than of little Charles.',\n",
       " 'The same story and the same raptures were repeated, when the two girls came with their father, through the gloom of the evening, to make enquiries; and Mr Musgrove, no longer under the first uneasiness about his heir, could add his confirmation and praise, and hope there would be now no occasion for putting Captain Wentworth off, and only be sorry to think that the cottage party, probably, would not like to leave the little boy, to give him the meeting.',\n",
       " 'Oh no; as to leaving the little boy,\" both father and mother were in much too strong and recent alarm to bear the thought; and Anne, in the joy of the escape, could not help adding her warm protestations to theirs.',\n",
       " 'Charles Musgrove, indeed, afterwards, shewed more of inclination; \"the child was going on so well, and he wished so much to be introduced to Captain Wentworth, that, perhaps, he might join them in the evening; he would not dine from home, but he might walk in for half an hour.',\n",
       " 'But in this he was eagerly opposed by his wife, with \"Oh! no, indeed, Charles, I cannot bear to have you go away.',\n",

       " 'This was quite a female case, and it would be highly absurd in him, who could be of no use at home, to shut himself up.',\n",
       " 'His father very much wished him to meet Captain Wentworth, and there being no sufficient reason against it, he ought to go; and it ended in his making a bold, public declaration, when he came in from shooting, of his meaning to dress directly, and dine at the other house.',\n",
       " 'Nothing can be going on better than the child,\" said he; \"so I told my father, just now, that I would come, and he thought me quite right.',\n",
