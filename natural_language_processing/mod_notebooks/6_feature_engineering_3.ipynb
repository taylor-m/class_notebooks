    "In a nutshell, the word2vec algorithm takes a corpus of text as input and generates a vector of several hundred dimensions for each word in the corpus. In doing this, it doesn't rely on the counts of the occurrences of the words. Instead, it follows a much more complicated procedure that considers the surrounding words of each word in the sentences.\n",

    "# What is word2vec?\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common feature-generation approach for NLP tasks is word2vec. What word2vec does is that it trains a shallow neural network model in an unsupervised manner for converting words to vectors. At the highest level of abstraction, word2vec assigns a vector of random values to each word. For a word *W*, it looks at the words that are near *W* in the sentence. It then shifts the values in the word vectors, such that the vectors for words near *W* are closer to the *W* vector, and vectors for words not near *W* are farther away from the *W* vector. With a large enough corpus, this will eventually result in words that often appear together having vectors that are near one another, and words that rarely or never appear together having vectors that are far away from each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "This may sound quite similar to the latent semantic analysis approach that you learned about in the previous checkpoint. The conceptual difference is that LSA creates vector representations of sentences based on the words in them, while word2vec creates representations of individual words, based on the words around them."

    "\n",
    "Word2vec is strong at capturing the meanings of the words, so it's also good at detecting words that have similar meanings. The challenge with human communication is that there are many different ways to communicate the same concept. It's easy for humans to know that `the silverware` and `the utensils` can refer to the same thing. But computers can't do that unless you teach them, and this can be a real choke point for human-computer interactions. If you've ever played a text adventure game like *Colossal Cave Adventure* or *Zork*, you may have encountered the following scenario:"

    "And your brain explodes from frustration. A text adventure game that incorporates a properly trained word2vec model would have vectors for `pick up`, `lift`, and `take` that are close to the vector for `grab`. Therefore, it could accept those other verbs as synonyms so that you could move ahead faster. In more practical applications, word2vec and other similar algorithms are what help a search engine return the best results for your query, not just the results that contain the exact words that you used. In fact, a search is a better example. Not only does the search engine need to understand your request, it also needs to match it to web pages that were also written by humans and therefore also use idiosyncratic language.\n",

    " * **Continuous bag of words (CBOW):** The identity of a word is predicted using the words near it in a sentence.\n",

Skip-gram will try to predict `is`, `a`, `better`, `than`, `a`, and `director` using the word `comedian`. In practice, for CBOW, the vector for `comedian` will be pulled closer to the other words. But for skip-gram, the vectors for the other words will be pulled closer to `comedian`.  \n",

    "## What is similarity? Strengths and weaknesses of word2vec\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind that word2vec operates on the assumption that frequent proximity indicates similarity, but words can be similar in various ways. They may be conceptually similar (`royal`, `king`, and `throne`), but they may also be functionally similar (`tremendous` and `negligible` are both common modifiers of `size`). Here is a more [detailed exploration, with examples](https://quomodocumque.wordpress.com/2016/01/15/messing-around-with-word2vec/), of what similarity means in word2vec.\n",
    "\n",
    "One cool thing about word2vec is that it can identify similarities between words that never occur near one another in the corpus. For example, consider these sentences:\n",
    "\n",
    "    \"The dog played with an elastic ball.\"\n",
    "    \"Babies prefer the ball that is bouncy.\"\n",
    "    \"I wanted to find a ball that's elastic.\"\n",
    "    \"Tracy threw a bouncy ball.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "`Elastic` and `bouncy` are similar in meaning in the text but don't appear in the same sentence. However, both appear near `ball`. In the process of nudging the vectors around so that `elastic` and `bouncy` are both near the vector for `ball`, the words also become nearer to one another and their similarity can be detected.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a while, after it was introduced, [no one was really sure why word2vec worked as well as it did](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1402.3722v1.pdf) (see the last paragraph of the linked paper). A few years later, some additional math was developed to explain word2vec and similar models. If you are comfortable with both math and academic writing, have a lot of time on your hands, and want to take a deep dive into the inner workings of word2vec, [check out this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03520v7.pdf) from 2016.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the draws of word2vec when it first came out was that the vectors could be used to convert analogies (`king` is to `queen` as `man` is to `woman`, for example) into mathematical expressions (`king` + `woman` - `man` = ?) and solve for the missing element (`queen`). This is kind of nifty.\n",
    "\n",
    "A drawback of word2vec is that it works best with a corpus that is at least several billion words long. Even though the word2vec algorithm is speedy, this is a lot of data and takes a long time! In the following examples, your dataset is very short. This allows you to run it in the Notebook without overwhelming the kernel, but probably won't give great results. Still, you'll explore how you can implement word2vec using the Gensim library."

So, the second option is to load a pretrained word2vec vector that's been trained on a very large corpus. After you train your word2vec representations, you'll also load a pretrained one.\n",

    "Well, the results make sense to some degree, but it's obvious that your representations aren't perfect. This is because your corpus is small. To get more meaningful results, you need to train word2vec representations using much larger corpora.\n",

    "Now, create your numerical features using the word2vec representations of the words. In the following, get the word2vec vectors of each word in a sentence. Then take the average of all the vectors in the high dimensional space (in your case, it's 100). So, as a result, you'll have a vector of 100 dimensions as the feature for a sentence. You can then use each dimension as a separate feature—which means that you'll have 100 numerical features in your final dataset."
