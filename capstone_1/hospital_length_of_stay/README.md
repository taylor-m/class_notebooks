# Data

    The experiment will research "hospital length of stay" data categorized as healthcare management. Resource management is one aspect of the healthcare industry that has been brought into question due to the recent COVID-19 pandemic because of a lack of resources available due to the inability to predict how long hospital beds will be in use. This dataset provides over 300,000 patient data records that culminate with the eventual length of the patient’s stay. The task with this dataset is to learn from the past information to best predict in future cases the likely length of stay to consider for prospective patients to allow for better planning and allocation of resources and to optimize efficiency.

# Research Design

    The obvious initial questions that can be asked of this dataset before more intricate models are designed is, which patient variables have the most significant effects in determining whether a patient stays less time or more time. The follow-up question to that is to what degree each of these parameters impacts the length of stay. Once we have a better understanding of each variable’s effect, then we can begin to paint a complete picture of how these variables interact together to determine the length of stay.
    
    The primary variables of interest are patient age, admission type, illness severity because it follows that older patients, emergency patients, and patients with an extreme condition should require more treatment. Secondary variables that the experiment will also consider are the bed grade that the patient is staying in, the type of hospital treating the patient, and the admission deposit. The primary variables are non-continuous because age is in range groups, and the other two variables are ordinal qualitative groups. The experiment will use non-parametric independent group testing.
    
# Audience

    The audience of this research proposal would be the healthcare management industry for the reasons stated above, but mainly for optimization of efficiency to give more information in terms of prediction modeling for future resource allocation. This information will be valuable to prevent healthcare entities from being overwhelmed due to insufficient data for planning.
